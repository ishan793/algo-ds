# algo-ds
This repository contains the code I end up writing while:

1. Practicing the questions in the Book Elements of Programming Interview, these go to the 'epi' folder
2. Trying out some data structure or algorithm, these go the 'algo_ds' folder
3. In case I do the question on the site leetcode.com offline, they got to 'leet' folder
4. As the name suggests, the code files in the 'random' folder, are well ..... random
